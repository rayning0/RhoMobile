My attempt to get the Rhodes framework (RhoMobile) to work. Made by Motorola, it's supposed to let you use Ruby to write NATIVE mobile apps for iPhone, Android, Blackberry, and Windows phones/tablets. Write once, use everywhere. You write Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, and ERB files, and it follows an MVC framework, like Ruby on Rails.  In practice, it gave me lots of errors and was a big hassle to use.

This presentation on RhoMobile sounded fantastic. I was excited:
